    # Step 2: Simulation Execution
    scenario_description = "Interest rate increase impact"
    simulation_id, simulation_results = SimulationService.run_simulation(scenario_description, interest_rate_scenario)

    # Step 3: In-depth Results Analysis
    # Store results in Amazon S3 and analyze with QuickSight
    aws_services.store_results_s3(simulation_id, simulation_results)
    analysis_report = aws_services.analyze_results_quicksight(simulation_id)

    # Step 4: Predictive Analytics
    # Use SageMaker for predictive modeling
    predictive_model = aws_services.create_predictive_model(loan_details)
    future_performance = predictive_model.predict(loan_details)

    # Step 5: Continuous Monitoring
