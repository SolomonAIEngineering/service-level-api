## Custom Methods

Custom methods refer to API methods besides the 5 standard methods. They should only be used for functionality that cannot be easily expressed via standard methods. In general, API designers should choose standard methods over custom methods whenever feasible. Standard Methods have simpler and well-defined semantics that most developers are familiar with, so they are easier to use and less error prone. Another advantage of standard methods is the API platform has better understanding and support for standard methods, such as billing, error handling, logging, monitoring.

A custom method can be associated with a resource, a collection, or a service. It may take an arbitrary request and return an arbitrary response, and also supports streaming request and response.

Custom method names must follow method naming conventions.

### [HTTP Naming](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/custom_methods#http_mapping)
For custom methods, they should use the following generic HTTP mapping:
```bash
https://service.name/v1/some/resource/name:customVerb
```

The reason to use : instead of / to separate the custom verb from the resource name is to support arbitrary paths. For example, undelete a file can map to POST /files/a/long/file/name:undelete

The following guidelines shall be applied when choosing the HTTP mapping:
* Custom methods should use HTTP POST verb since it has the most flexible semantics, except for methods serving as an alternative get or list which may use GET when possible. (See third bullet for specifics.)
* Custom methods should not use HTTP PATCH, but may use other HTTP verbs. In such cases, the methods must follow the standard HTTP semantics for that verb.
* Notably, custom methods using HTTP GET must be idempotent and have no side effects. For example custom methods that implement special views on the resource should use HTTP GET.
* The request message field(s) receiving the resource name of the resource or collection with which the custom method is associated should map to the URL path.
* The URL path must end with a suffix consisting of a colon followed by the custom verb.
* If the HTTP verb used for the custom method allows an HTTP request body (this applies to POST, PUT, PATCH, or a custom HTTP verb), the HTTP configuration of that custom method must use the body: "*" clause and all remaining request message fields shall map to the HTTP request body.
* If the HTTP verb used for the custom method does not accept an HTTP request body (GET, DELETE), the HTTP configuration of such method must not use the body clause at all, and all remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters.

```proto
// This is a service level custom method.
rpc Watch(WatchRequest) returns (WatchResponse) {
  // Custom method maps to HTTP POST. All request parameters go into body.
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v1:watch"
    body: "*"
  };
}

// This is a collection level custom method.
rpc ClearEvents(ClearEventsRequest) returns (ClearEventsResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v3/events:clear"
    body: "*"
  };
}

// This is a resource level custom method.
rpc CancelEvent(CancelEventRequest) returns (CancelEventResponse) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    post: "/v3/{name=events/*}:cancel"
    body: "*"
  };
}

// This is a batch get custom method.
rpc BatchGetEvents(BatchGetEventsRequest) returns (BatchGetEventsResponse) {
  // The batch get method maps to HTTP GET verb.
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v3/events:batchGet"
  };
}
```

### Common Names
| Method Name | Custom Verb | HTTP Verb | Note                                                                                     |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cancel      | :cancel     | POST      | Cancel an outstanding operation, such as operations.cancel.                              |
| BatchGet    | :batchGet   | GET       | Batch get of multiple resources. See details in the description of List.                |
| Move        | :move       | POST      | Move a resource from one parent to another, such as folders.move.                       |
| Search      | :search     | GET       | Alternative to List for fetching data that does not adhere to List semantics, such as services.search. |
| Undelete    | :undelete   | POST      | Restore a resource that was previously deleted, such as services.undelete. The recommended retention period is 30-day. |
