## [Resource Names](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name)
In resource-oriented APIs, resources are named entities, and resource names are their identifiers. Each resource must have its own unique resource name. The resource name is made up of the ID of the resource itself, the IDs of any parent resources, and its API service name. We'll look at resource IDs and how a resource name is constructed below.

gRPC APIs should use scheme-less URIs for resource names. They generally follow the REST URL conventions and behave much like network file paths. They can be easily mapped to REST URLs: see the Standard Methods section for details.

A collection is a special kind of resource that contains a list of sub-resources of identical type. For example, a directory is a collection of file resources. The resource ID for a collection is called collection ID.

The resource name is organized hierarchically using collection IDs and resource IDs, separated by forward slashes. If a resource contains a sub-resource, the sub-resource's name is formed by specifying the parent resource name followed by the sub-resource's ID - again, separated by forward slashes.

### Example 1: Storage Service

| API Service Name         | Collection ID 1 | Resource ID 1 | Collection ID 2 | Resource ID 2 |
|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| //storage.googleapis.com | /buckets        | /bucket-id    | /objects        | /object-id    |

### Example 2: Email Service

| API Service Name       | Collection ID 1 | Resource ID 1     | Collection ID 2 | Resource ID 2 |
|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| //mail.googleapis.com  | /users          | /name@example.com | /settings       | /customFrom   |


An API producer can choose any acceptable value for resource and collection IDs as long as they are unique within the resource hierarchy. You can find more guidelines for choosing appropriate resource and collection IDs below.

By splitting the resource name, such as name.split("/")[n], one can obtain the individual collection IDs and resource IDs, assuming none of the segments contains any forward slash.

### Example 
```proto
service LibraryService {
  rpc GetBook(GetBookRequest) returns (Book) {
    option (google.api.http) = {
      get: "/v1/{name=shelves/*/books/*}"
    };
  };
  rpc CreateBook(CreateBookRequest) returns (Book) {
    option (google.api.http) = {
      post: "/v1/{parent=shelves/*}/books"
      body: "book"
    };
  };
}

message Book {
  // Resource name of the book. It must have the format of "shelves/*/books/*".
  // For example: "shelves/shelf1/books/book2".
  string name = 1;

  // ... other properties
}

message GetBookRequest {
  // Resource name of a book. For example: "shelves/shelf1/books/book2".
  string name = 1;
}

message CreateBookRequest {
  // Resource name of the parent resource where to create the book.
  // For example: "shelves/shelf1".
  string parent = 1;
  // The Book resource to be created. Client must not set the `Book.name` field.
  Book book = 2;
}
```
