##### Sample Table Schema for Admin Roles

The database schema focuses on storing information about administrators, their roles, and their privileges in a relational database.

##### Tables and Fields

1. **Admins Table**: Stores information about each administrator.
   - `admin_id` (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each admin.
   - `username`: The admin's username.
   - `password_hash`: A hashed version of the admin's password (for security).
   - `email`: The admin's email address.
   - `last_login`: Timestamp of the last login.

2. **Roles Table**: Defines the different roles that an admin can have.
   - `role_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each role.
   - `role_name`: Name of the role (e.g., SuperAdmin, DataViewer, UserManager).

3. **AdminRoles Table**: Links admins to their roles (many-to-many relationship).
   - `admin_id` (Foreign Key): References `admin_id` in the Admins table.
   - `role_id` (Foreign Key): References `role_id` in the Roles table.

4. **Privileges Table**: Lists the specific actions or access privileges each role has.
   - `privilege_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each privilege.
   - `privilege_description`: Description of the privilege (e.g., ViewFinancialData, EditUserProfiles).

5. **RolePrivileges Table**: Links roles to their privileges (many-to-many relationship).
   - `role_id` (Foreign Key): References `role_id` in the Roles table.
   - `privilege_id` (Foreign Key): References `privilege_id` in the Privileges table.

##### Sample SQL Creation Scripts

```sql
CREATE TABLE Admins (
    admin_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE Roles (
    role_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    role_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE AdminRoles (
    admin_id INT,
    role_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (admin_id) REFERENCES Admins(admin_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES Roles(role_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Privileges (
    privilege_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    privilege_description VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE RolePrivileges (
    role_id INT,
    privilege_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES Roles(role_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (privilege_id) REFERENCES Privileges(privilege_id)
);
```

### Normalization and Data Integrity

- **Normalization**: This design is normalized to at least the Third Normal Form (3NF). Each table represents a single entity type, and every non-key attribute is non-transitively dependent on the primary key.
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity. Primary keys ensure uniqueness within each table. Additional constraints (like unique constraints on usernames and emails) can be added as needed.

This schema effectively separates concerns, maintains data integrity, and supports complex queries involving admins, their roles, and privileges.


### Data Privacy
Given the sensitivity of the financial data handled by the platform, stringent data privacy measures are essential.

- **Policies for Handling Sensitive Financial Data:**
  - **Access Control:** Strict access control policies to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive financial data.
  - **Data Handling Protocols:** Establish clear protocols for the handling, storage, and transmission of sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.

- **Anonymization Techniques Where Applicable:**
  - **Data Anonymization:** Implement data anonymization techniques for scenarios where personal data needs to be used for analysis or reporting without compromising individual privacy.
  - **Compliance with Privacy Laws:** Ensure that all anonymization techniques are in compliance with privacy laws like GDPR, especially regarding the use and sharing of personal data.

## 8. Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
Implementing robust security protocols to protect against unauthorized access.

- **Use of OAuth, JWT, or Similar Protocols:**
  - **OAuth:** Implement OAuth for secure delegated access, allowing users to grant limited access to their resources without exposing their credentials.
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Utilize JWT for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - **Defined User Roles:** Clearly define user roles and associated permissions to control access to different parts of the platform based on the user's role.
