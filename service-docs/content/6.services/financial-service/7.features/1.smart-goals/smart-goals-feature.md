These features leverage the power of AI to provide users with a more interactive and insightful financial planning experience.

### 1. Notes on Goals
**Feature Description:**

- Notes should be timestamped to track progress or changes in strategy over time.

### 2. Milestone Creation

### 3. Goal Forecasting
**Feature Description:**
- This feature will use AI to predict the likely outcome of a goal based on current savings rate, investment returns, and spending habits.

**User Journey:**
- If a user is falling short on their savings target, the forecasting tool can project when they are likely to achieve their goal with the current trend.

**Technical Implementation:**
- The `Forecast` message schema will be used for creating forecasts.
- Forecasts will provide insights like forecasted completion dates and variance amounts.

### 4. Actionable Insights Based on OpenAI
**Feature Description:**
